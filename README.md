# How to use

1. Open view the raw code for [vaccheck.min.js](https://github.com/fuomag9/VacBanChecker/blob/master/vaccheck.min.js).
2. Select all (ctrl + a)
3. Copy (ctrl + c)
4. Bookmark this (or any) page.
5. Right click your new bookmark and edit it. In the **URL** or **Location** field, paste the contents of [vaccheck.min.js](https://github.com/fuomag9/VacBanChecker/blob/master/vaccheck.min.js). You can rename the name too.
6. Navigate to your [friends recently played with](http://steamcommunity.com/my/friends/coplay) page. (You could probably bookmark that too :wink:)
7. Click the bookmarklet and it will use the Steam API to get a list of VAC bans for those users on that page.

Pro tip: This bookmarklet also works under the other tabs on that page, including the "All Friends" tab! And it also
works on your friend's friends list! Just go to their profile page, click "Friends" on the right panel, and use the bookmarklet to see their friend's vac bans!

Credits go out to [iEyepawd](http://www.reddit.com/user/iEyepawd) from this [reddit post](http://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/348292/i_made_a_userscript_to_easily_show_vac_bans_on/). His idea inspired me to write a version that can be easily used as a bookmarklet.
